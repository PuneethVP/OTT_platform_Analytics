# Youthful Eyes on OTT: A Global Content Production Analysis

- In this project, our primary aim is to investigate the potential correlation between the proportion of young people in a country and the quantity of content generated on Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms. Over the top platforms are online platforms which provides content release services and provide contents to the consumer over the internet. It gets its name Over the top (OTT) as the contents are released over the top of the internet services. Here, We wanted to differentiate between longer formats, such as TV shows, and shorter formats like movies. Our study seeks to determine whether the presence of a youthful demographic in a country has a discernible impact on the overall volume of content produced on OTT platforms.

# Fuzzy Matching and Sentence Transformer
- Sentence Transformers are models that transform text into fixed-size numerical representations (embeddings) suitable for various natural language processing tasks, including similarity calculations.
- These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing for effective comparison between sentences.
- FuzzyWuzzy, on the other hand, is a library in Python that provides fuzzy string matching capabilities, allowing you to compare strings or sequences of text and determine their similarity based on various algorithms like Levenshtein distance, among others.
# Basic approach to using Sentence Transformers and FuzzyWuzzy together
- Generate embeddings for your sentences using a Sentence Transformer model to represent the semantic meaning of the text.
- Use the generated embeddings to compute the similarity between sentences. You can use cosine similarity or other distance metrics to compare the embeddings and quantify their similarity.
- If needed, you can use FuzzyWuzzy to perform additional string matching or similarity calculations based on different algorithms provided by the library. However, keep in mind that FuzzyWuzzy primarily operates on the textual level and doesn't leverage semantic embeddings like Sentence Transformers do.
- Combining these two approaches can provide a more comprehensive understanding of similarity by considering both the semantic meaning of text (captured by embeddings from Sentence Transformers) and the character-level or token-level similarities measured by FuzzyWuzzy.
- Providing embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers to FuzzyWuzzy for similarity comparison could potentially reduce the time taken by FuzzyWuzzy to generate similarity scores. This is because the embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers encode the semantic information of the text into fixed-size numerical representations.
- When you use embeddings from Sentence Transformers for comparison with FuzzyWuzzy, you bypass the need for FuzzyWuzzy to process and analyze the raw text directly. Instead, FuzzyWuzzy operates on the embeddings, which are already condensed representations capturing the semantic meaning of the text. This can lead to a reduction in the computational time required for FuzzyWuzzy to compute similarity scores since it's comparing numerical representations rather than analyzing the raw text character by character.
- When we ran without sentence transformer the time taken to execute and match titles was approximately around 7-10 hours and now this has been reduced to 2.5 hours after implementing Sentence Transformers and Fuzzy Wuzzy together.
